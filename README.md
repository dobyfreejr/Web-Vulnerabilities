 ## **Testing Web Applications for Vulnerabilities**

### *Web Application 1: Your Wish is My Command Injection*

### *1.Provide a screenshot confirming that you successfully completed this exploit:*

### *2.Write two or three sentences outlining mitigation strategies for this vulnerability:* 

     Avoid command line calls altogether if possible. Use APIs only when possible

     Setup input validation command injection vulnerabilities occur when untrusted input is not sanitized correctly. A white list of possible be created for the system to accepts only the pre approved inputs and avoid the follow characters : & | ` 

     Run with restricted permissions- reduce the number of users access to the database and secure the locations of all confidential files and the directories 


### *Web Application 2: A Brute Force to Be Reckoned With*

### *Provide a screenshot confirming that you successfully completed this exploit:*

### *Write two or three sentences outlining mitigation strategies for this vulnerability:* 

     Locking Account after a fixed number of failed attempts.

     Making the usernames and passwords more complex and make sure people change their passwords often. 

     Lockout the IP address if there is multiple attempts to login 

     Brute force site scanners. Sc the logs to see if there is was a brute force recently.




### *Web Application 3: Where's the BeEF?*

### *Write two or three sentences outlining mitigation strategies for this vulnerability:* 

     Change your password regularly. Always assume you have been compromised. Keep system in virgin state and always update on recently software changes.
